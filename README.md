This package implements several estimators of the [Bayes error
rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_error_rate) of a data set for
a classification task. The Bayes error rate is a measure of how well the
features of the data can discriminate among the classes. It gives the
*best possible* error rate attainable from the data. If the
distributions of the classes overlap, then the Bayes error rate must be
greater than zero.

There are three parametric estimates: 1. Mahalanobis distance 2.
Bhattacharyya distance 3. Chernoff bound

And three non-parametric estimates: 4. Nearest Neighbor 5. Classifier
Ensembles 6. Plurality Error
